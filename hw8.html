      <h2>Explanation of AJAX</h2>
      <p>
        In the code above, we have a button that triggers an AJAX request to get
        the CD collection from the XML file "cd_catalog.xml". When the button is
        clicked, the "loadDoc" function is called which creates an
        XMLHttpRequest object and sends a GET request to the specified URL. The
        response from the server is handled by the "myFunction" function which
        extracts the data from the XML document and populates the HTML table
        with it.
      </p>
      <h2>Random Fox API</h2>
      <p>
        The Random Fox API is a RESTful API that allows developers to retrieve
        random images of foxes in JSON format. This API is a great resource for
        developers looking to add some fun and randomness to their applications,
        as well as those looking to incorporate images of foxes into their
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        To access and use the API, you do not need any type of key or
        authentication. The API is completely open and free to use for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The response file you get is in JSON format, which is a lightweight data
        interchange format that is easy for machines to parse and generate, and
        is human-readable and easy to debug.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no fee to use the Random Fox API. It is completely free and
        open for everyone to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started with the API, you can visit the Random Fox API
        documentation at
        <a href="https://randomfox.ca/" target="_blank"
          >this link, Random Fox CA</a
        >. The documentation provides detailed information on how to use the
        API, including the API endpoint, query parameters, and example requests
        and responses. It also includes code snippets in various programming
        languages to help developers get started quickly.

      <h2>REST Countries API</h2>
      <p>
        REST Countries is a free API that provides a wealth of information about
        countries around the world. With REST Countries, you can easily retrieve
        data about a country's name, capital, population, borders, and much
        more. It's a great API for building applications that need to display
        country-specific information.
